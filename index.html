			<h2> Bio </h2>
			<p>
				Stuff about me that is really coool and interesting. But it also has to be pretty short liek maybe 4-5 sentences. This is the third sentence of my bio. And here is the fourth, maybe it should be a bit longer. And onto the fifth, also needs to be fairly long to simulate what it will actually look like, maybe this is a good amount.
